 # MyG : No brain No gain !

### **Inspiration**
The world and Algeria in particular know a tendency on gyms and the organization of the Championship of Africa of the discipline and the Fitness Challenge here in Algeria has incited us to lean on this domain.

### **What it does**
MyG is an intelligent futurstic gym that ensures the comfort of its users, their safety and the sustainability of resources. by providing 3 main features : 
> - personalized and self-updated recommendation system to ensure the progress of the gym's room. 
> - ensure the safety of trainees in the building through a system of recognition of dangerous movements. 
> -Reduction of water consumption by means of an early water heating system

### **How we built it**
## **MyG system contains :**

> - a mobile app where trainees find their daily plan and coachs receive alerts when a dangerous movement is detected
> - Scanners for collecting data about trainees performance from sport equipement
> - Cameras for detecting these dangerous movements , facial recognation and counting number of valid reps of exercices done
> - mated Heating systeme for water usage 
> - Challenges we ran into Our main challenge were to make different parts of the system interact with each other. collect data Having the ballence between the cost and performance of the system ## Accomplishments that we're proud of 

We are proud of being able to implement the solution with all its features in such a tight perioud of time and a high pressure. We accomplished the following:
mobile application for gym trainees and coachs.
model of face recognition.
model that count number of repititions of gym exercice (push ups).
algorithm recommandation of daily gym plan workout.
What we learned
We learned how we divide time efficiently, prioritizing work and team spirit, how to train models

What's next for MyG
We want to extend MyG for the future by: -evolve B2C (business to client because for the moment we are b2b business to business only) by creating a general app.

Add to the system position correction feature,eliminating almost entirely the need for a coach.
Introduce the notion of diet into the system.
